# Job Openings Tracker
Get notified of new job openings. Works by polling one or more job posting systems for new openings and notifying via one or more notifiers (e.g. email).

## Rationale
Many job posting systems might have things like RSS feeds, but at least one does not. When looking for a job, it might be nice to be notified of new openings in particular companies of interest.
